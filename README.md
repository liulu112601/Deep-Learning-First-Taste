# Deep-Learning-First-Taste
- This is a summary of the DL basic knowledge I was working on when I came to UTS in 2017.

- Thanks for the careful instructions given by my supervisor: [Guodong Long](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/guodong.long).

- This repo includes two folders: 1. implementations for classical algorithms of Deep Reinforcement Learning 2. implementations following the deep learning course by Google on Udacity.
